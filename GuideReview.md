## Commenting on/Offering Feedback on a Lesson for PierceHacker
Question 9 confused me on the revised survey it asked me two questions but only gave me the prompt to answer the second question. Question 14 I liked the way the writer used humor in his answer prompt.
## Audience
Students are being addressed so this surveys's audience is very clear

## Getting Ready
You need access to a PC/laptop to take this survey 

## Skimmability
Surveys should be easy to read and clear questions should be established. I did get stuck on question 9 since I couldnt fully answer the question.
## Payoff
I think this revsion on this survey needs some work and did not really see many actual changes from the initial survey

## Workflow
This survey was the appropriate length short surveys are always better.
