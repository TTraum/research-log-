Hey I'm Dario Brandt originally from Germany currently on my second quarter at Pierce College, I am currently in the Military as a logistician wich is fancy word for truck driver. Married with three kids. Hobbies include computer gaming, hiking, and spending time finding new places to eat.
What I assumed technical writing was before I took the class was, I would be translateing complex terms and lingo that programers or software engineers used into words that anyone could understand and follow. After my first week it my assumption alligned pretty close to what the class is about.
Setting up and using github was diffrent at first but after following the hello world guide, which is actually techical writing made alot of sense to me and made it pretty easy to setup and get started. The language in the guide was really easy to follow and the GIFs showing me what I should be clicking on helped me alot. The plain language the guide used made it easy to follow it was really step-by-step, wich I appreciated. My initial feelings which was a little frustrated was cleared up once I had an account and started this log.

The Programming Historian and PierceHacker are perhaps many things, but they are I believe technical writing projects at their core. Our reading “The Rhetorical Nature of Technical and Professional Writing” frames tech writing as fundementally rhetorical. This means that questions of purpose, audience, and medium of delivery are fundemental to the work of technical writing. Consider – who is the particular audience for The Programming Historian? For Pierce Hacker? What is the purpose of The Programming Historian? Of PierceHacker? Why do you think the writers/designers of these projects decided to deliver their work via the medium of a public website?
Finally, as best you can, try to articulate what you feel you’ve learned this week?
